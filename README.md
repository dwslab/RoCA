# RoCA - Root Cause Analysis in IT Landscapes using Markov Logic Networks

- - -

RoCA is a graphical tool to model IT infrastructures. It uses [ontologies](www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/) and [Markov Logic Networks (MLN)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-006-5833-1#page-1) as internal representation. Based on the modeled infrastructure and provided evidence about available and unavailable components it conducts a root cause analysis, calculating the most probable underlying source of the observed unavailabilities. RoCA is the result of the project [Development of a risk management tool for complex technical systems](http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/en/projects/current-projects/#c13643).

RoCA translates the modeled infrastructure into a special MLN for abductive reasoning (inference to the best explanation). To find the root cause RoCA calculates the MAP state of the MLN. We use [RockIt](https://code.google.com/p/rockit/) as MLN solver. 


## Installation

### Prerequisites
RoCA requires the following software to be installed to run:

* [Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8](http://java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp?locale=en) 
* [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) (free academic license available)
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
  Needed by RockIt. By default, it uses the following user account:
  * `sql_username = root`
  * `sql_password = mannheim1234` 

### Verifying the installation
You can verify from the console that all environment variables are set correctly: 
* Run the command `java -version`. The first line should show something like `java version "1.8.0_XX"`.
* Run `echo %PATH%` (Windows) or `echo $PATH` (Linux). The output must contain the `bin` folder of your Gurobi installation (and the path to the JRE 1.8).
* Run `echo %GUROBI_HOME%` or `echo $GUROBI_HOME`. It should point to root of your Gurobi installation.

### Starting RoCA
A binary to run RoCA can be [downloaded here](http://web.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/risk/).
To start the GUI either double-click on the JAR-file or execute the command `java -jar roca-XXX.jar` from a console in the folder where you put the binary.

## Usage
RoCA comes with a default MLN and a default background ontology to get you started. After starting the application an empty model is presented. You can either load information about your infrastructure from an MLN evidence file or an ontology, or start from scratch. When your model is finished and contains all necessary or available information, you can start RockIt to run the root cause analysis.

### Loading Evidence
Evidence can be loaded form the menu *Root Cause Analysis* with the menu point *Load Evidence...*.

After selecting a file and loading it, the graph of the model is displayed an can than be edited.

### Editing a Model

You can edit the model by either drag&drop of new elements from the palette on the left side, or draw new edges between already placed components. RoCA automatically determines the type of an edge (*dependsOn* between components, *hasRiskDegree* between a components and risks). By double-clicking on a component or an edge you can edit its properties: *name* and *state* for componentes, and *weight* for relations.

### Running the Root Cause Analysis
The root cause analyis can also be started from the menu. A dialog is shown that updates with the current progress.

When the root cause analysis is finished, a popup with the proposed most probable cause is displayed.
