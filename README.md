# RoCA - Root Cause Analysis in IT Landscapes using Markov Logic Networks

- - -

RoCA is a graphical tool to model IT infrastructures. It uses [ontologies](www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/) and [Markov Logic Networks (MLN)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-006-5833-1#page-1) as internal representation. Based on the modeled infrastructure and provided evidence about available and unavailable components it conducts a root cause analysis, calculating the most probable underlying source of the observed unavailabilities. RoCA is the result of the project [Development of a risk management tool for complex technical systems](http://dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/en/projects/current-projects/#c13643).

RoCA uses [RockIt](https://code.google.com/p/rockit/) as MLN solver.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
RoCA requires the following software to be installed to run:

* [Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8](http://java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp?locale=en) 
* [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) (free academic license available)
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Starting RoCA
A binary to run RoCA can be downloaded from the [project homepage](http://dwslab.github.io/RoCA).
To start the  either double-clicking on the JAR-file or by 
executing `java -jar roca-XXX.jar`. Your PATH variable has to include the path
to the JRE 1.8 `bin` folder.
